    A comprehensive contact management and waitlist system built with FastAPI and PostgreSQL
  </p>

---

## Overview

**Looply** is a modern, production-ready API service for managing contacts, organizing them into lists, and handling waitlist workflows. It provides a robust foundation for contact management applications with features like full-text search, status tracking, and multi-list organization.

## Features

### üìá Contact Management

- **Comprehensive contact profiles**: Store detailed contact information including names, company, job title, phone, email, address, and notes
- **Full-text search**: PostgreSQL-powered full-text search across all contact fields with weighted relevance
- **Duplicate prevention**: Automatic detection and prevention of duplicate emails and phone numbers
- **Contact types**: Organize contacts by type (personal, business, etc.)
- **Active/inactive status**: Enable or disable contacts as needed

### üìã Contact Lists

- **Create and manage lists**: Organize contacts into custom lists with names and descriptions
- **Member management**: Add, remove, and query contacts in lists
- **Bidirectional relationships**: Find all lists a contact belongs to
- **Member counting**: Quickly retrieve member counts for any list

### ‚è≥ Waiting Lists

- **Advanced status tracking**: Manage waiting list members with comprehensive status workflow:
  - `pending` - Awaiting approval or notification
  - `approved` - Approved for the waitlist
  - `rejected` - Rejected from the waitlist
  - `notified` - Member has been notified
  - `accepted` - Member accepted their spot
  - `declined` - Member declined their spot
  - `active` - Currently active
  - `inactive` - Currently inactive
  - `cancelled` - Cancelled participation
- **Status queries**: Filter members by status and get counts by status
- **Bulk operations**: Update multiple members' status simultaneously
- **Member history**: Track when members joined and status changes

### üë§ User Management

- **User profiles**: Manage user accounts with email, username, and profile information
- **Authentication**: Integrated with Tessera SDK for authentication and authorization
- **Multi-tenant support**: Each resource is scoped to the creating user

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: FastAPI (async Python web framework)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: Tessera SDK (JWT-based authentication)
- **Pagination**: fastapi-pagination for efficient list endpoints
- **Validation**: Pydantic for data validation
- **Migrations**: Alembic for database migrations
- **Observability**:
  - Rollbar for error tracking
  - OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
- **Background Jobs**: Celery for asynchronous task processing
- **Cache**: Redis for caching and background job queues
- **Email**: Postmarker for email delivery

## Architecture

The service follows a clean architecture pattern:

```text

## Key Features

### Full-Text Search
Contacts include a PostgreSQL `tsvector` column that automatically indexes all text fields (names, company, email, phone, address, notes) with weighted relevance for fast searching.

### Soft Deletes
All resources support soft deletion - items are marked as deleted but remain in the database for audit purposes.

### Pagination
List endpoints use `fastapi-pagination` to provide consistent, efficient pagination across all resources.

### Multi-Tenancy
Resources are automatically scoped to the authenticated user who created them, ensuring data isolation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
